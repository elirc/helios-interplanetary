# Helios / astra1: Debugging and test-design interview

Work one case at a time in approximately 35 minutes. These are six distinct scenarios viewed through this interview round. Select a case you have not recently rehearsed. The [source map](../README.md), [scorecard](../SCORECARD.md), and [project defense](../PROJECT-DEFENSE.md) support your attempt. Afterward use the [separate interviewer notes](../_interviewer/rounds/05-debugging.md).

## How to run this round

Treat this case as a bug report whose mechanism has not yet been confirmed. Write two competing hypotheses and one observation that distinguishes them. Identify the first boundary you would inspect in the supplied source map. Avoid beginning with a broad rewrite or assuming the case describes a current production defect.

Build a minimal reproduction from the fixture. Preserve the exact input and the ordering of events. Record expected and observed behavior separately. If a necessary dependency is unavailable, specify the smallest integration setup and mark its runtime result pending; a proposed test is not a completed investigation.

The interviewer will offer a patch that makes the visible symptom disappear while leaving the invariant broken. Explain which assertion would reject that patch. Choose between a pure test, adapter test, component test, or database test based on the boundary under investigation, and identify one mock that would make the test uninformative.

Deliver a concise incident note: symptom, hypotheses, distinguishing observation, confirmed or unconfirmed cause, focused change, tests, and remaining risk. Include a before/after example and avoid claiming all adjacent behavior was verified by one focused check.

## 06.5.1 — The last transaction step fails

**Scenario.** A repair performs several writes and fails while inserting the postmortem. The repository already has a focused rollback regression; this is an explanation exercise, not a claim of a newly discovered defect.

**Starting fixture.** Reservation consumed; work order completed; postmortem insert rejected.

Your user is a authorized operations user; the affected surface is the operations hub and workflow history. Keep organization, command identity, and authorized operation visible in the model. The user-facing operation is to complete a repair or record a journal transition.

### Project-specific follow-through

Start at the [project source map](../README.md), then trace authorized server command and PostgreSQL transaction. Locate one current symbol that supports your explanation and one assumption the fixture adds. If the application already handles the scenario, characterize that behavior instead of inventing a fix. Record the repository state you inspected so later changes do not silently invalidate your answer.

Before opening the interviewer notes, write a result for the supplied fixture and one counterexample of your own. Ask the interviewer to vary exactly one fact, then explain what changes and what stays invariant. Finish with one sentence naming the evidence that would be needed to move from this practice answer to an application claim.

**Evidence to keep:** your first prediction, the artifact requested in this round, the strongest follow-up question, your revised explanation, and any check that remains unrun. Repeating the same answer faster is not the goal; surviving a changed input is.

## 06.5.2 — A successful command is replayed

**Scenario.** The client loses a response and repeats the same command. The operation has already committed once.

**Starting fixture.** Command K completed; response lost; K submitted again.

Your user is a authorized operations user; the affected surface is the operations hub and workflow history. Keep organization, command identity, and authorized operation visible in the model. The user-facing operation is to complete a repair or record a journal transition.

## 06.5.3 — Two balanced groups cancel a mistake globally

**Scenario.** A synthetic report adds all journal lines across organizations. One group has a debit surplus and another a credit surplus; the overall sum looks balanced.

**Starting fixture.** OrgA/J1 debit100 credit90; OrgB/J2 debit90 credit100.

Your user is a authorized operations user; the affected surface is the operations hub and workflow history. Keep organization, command identity, and authorized operation visible in the model. The user-facing operation is to complete a repair or record a journal transition.

### Project-specific follow-through

## 06.5.4 — Actual usage exceeds a reservation

**Scenario.** A simulated operation reserves thirty units but later reports forty-five actual units. Hiding the difference would make the usage ledger misleading.

**Starting fixture.** Cap100; spent60; reserved30; actual45.

Your user is a authorized operations user; the affected surface is the operations hub and workflow history. Keep organization, command identity, and authorized operation visible in the model. The user-facing operation is to complete a repair or record a journal transition.

## 06.5.5 — Telemetry is fresh but the incident is not resolved

**Scenario.** A recent request metric exists while the operational workflow is still pending. The interviewer asks what this observation proves.

**Starting fixture.** HTTP observation atT; incident pending sinceT-100; worker progress unknown.

Your user is a authorized operations user; the affected surface is the operations hub and workflow history. Keep organization, command identity, and authorized operation visible in the model. The user-facing operation is to complete a repair or record a journal transition.

## 06.5.6 — A proposed feature is described as completed

**Scenario.** A project has a future-work backlog and a completed local checkpoint. An interview answer accidentally merges them into a claim that every proposed capability was shipped.

**Starting fixture.** Completed Run003; future-work story still awaiting review.
