# 06. Helios / astra1: worked examples and learning journals

Helios is a local operations simulation with durable workflows and PostgreSQL. Explain one verified repair transition and its rollback boundary. Keep historical verification, fixture behavior, and your own contributions separate from production claims.

This fourth block complements the [original foundations](../README.md), [second practice block](../expansion-02/README.md), and [interview library](../interview-03/README.md). It adds slower, solved explanations and several ways to work through the same mechanism. Earlier files and unfinished exercises are preserved.

## Choose how to begin today

- **Read a complete example:** choose a slow explanation below. It starts with a concrete fixture and derives the expected result.
- **Follow a narrated thought process:** use a worked journal. These are explicitly fictional teaching narratives, not records of your work or new production incidents.
- **See the relationships:** use the workshop diagrams and model trace tables. Label references, requests, and state ownership separately.
- **Run and inspect:** start with [the runnable worked notebook](WORKED-NOTEBOOK.md), which checks three concrete examples against the existing teaching reference.
- **Speak and reflect:** follow a workshop's teach-back route and use [your own journal template](MY-JOURNAL.md).

These are complementary activities, not fixed categories of people. Switch formats when it helps you notice a missing assumption. The [learning pathways](PATHWAYS.md) and [review plan](REVIEW-PLAN.md) offer bounded sessions so this library does not become a requirement to read everything in sequence.

## Six project cases, three complementary treatments

| Case | Situation | Explanation | Narrative | Activity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The last transaction step fails | [Read slowly](explanations/01.md) | [Worked journal](journals/01.md) | [Draw / build / speak](workshops/01.md) |
| 2 | A successful command is replayed | [Read slowly](explanations/02.md) | [Worked journal](journals/02.md) | [Draw / build / speak](workshops/02.md) |
| 3 | Two balanced groups cancel a mistake globally | [Read slowly](explanations/03.md) | [Worked journal](journals/03.md) | [Draw / build / speak](workshops/03.md) |
| 4 | Actual usage exceeds a reservation | [Read slowly](explanations/04.md) | [Worked journal](journals/04.md) | [Draw / build / speak](workshops/04.md) |
| 5 | Telemetry is fresh but the incident is not resolved | [Read slowly](explanations/05.md) | [Worked journal](journals/05.md) | [Draw / build / speak](workshops/05.md) |
| 6 | A proposed feature is described as completed | [Read slowly](explanations/06.md) | [Worked journal](journals/06.md) | [Draw / build / speak](workshops/06.md) |

The situations extend the earlier interview scenarios. Their new treatments are solved reasoning, reflection, and transfer practice rather than another set of unanswered interview prompts. A scenario can describe a synthetic failure without asserting that the current application contains that defect.

## Twenty-six transferable worked models

These model chapters are intentionally available in each project pack for a self-contained reading route. Their technical core is shared across projects; the source connection and local case references adapt the learning context. Do not count them as 260 different algorithms.

- [Three values that truthiness collapses](models/05-missing-null-zero.md)

## Source map and evidence boundaries

- [docs/project/current-state.md](<../../../docs/project/current-state.md>)
- [docs/exec-plans/003-repair-rollback-regression.md](<../../../docs/exec-plans/003-repair-rollback-regression.md>)
- [src/server/queries.ts](<../../../src/server/queries.ts>)
- [src/server/billing.ts](<../../../src/server/billing.ts>)
- [src/domain/contracts.ts](<../../../src/domain/contracts.ts>)
- [upskilling/repair-rollback/README.md](<../../repair-rollback/README.md>)

The actual boundary to investigate is authorized server command and PostgreSQL transaction. Current source determines what the app does; a teaching model may introduce a simplified field, policy, or serialized execution order. Keep source reading, model execution, and application verification distinct. Human mastery remains unassessed until the learner produces their own explanation and evidence.
